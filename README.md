# Daily DSA & LeetCode Practice

This repository contains my daily solutions to coding problems from platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, and others. I'm using this repo to improve my data structures and algorithms (DSA) skills and stay consistent with daily problem-solving.

## Structure

- /LeetCode/ – Solutions to LeetCode problems
- /HackerRank/ – HackerRank challenges
- /DSA Topics/ – Topic-wise practice (e.g., Arrays, Trees, Graphs)

## Languages Used
- C++

## Goals

- Solve at least 1 problem every day
- Improve problem-solving speed and accuracy
- Prepare for coding interviews

## How to Use

Each folder contains:
- The problem statement link (in comments)
- My code solution
- Notes or explanations (if any)
